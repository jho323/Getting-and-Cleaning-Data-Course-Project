# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Peer graded course project that demonstrates your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Below is a description of the function of each script

codeBook.md is a guide to the abbreviations in each data set.

test_analysis.R and train_analysis.R pull together test and train data into a test data frame and a train data frame.



run_analysis.R is a single script that:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
